# VirtuOhm Connector

This is a tool to collect your information from VirtuOhm (*for students of TH Nuremberg*).

I created it so I do not have to bother using the web service too much.

## Features
- Display and export current semester grades or all existing grades to CSV and HTML
- Display how many credits (ECTS) you have earned
- Display Study Progress

## Installation
- (optional) set up a python virtual environment (*e.g. with pyenv*)
- install the libraries with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
- run the app with `python main.py`
