# VirtuOhm Connector

This is a tool to collect your information from VirtuOhm (*for students of TH Nuremberg*).

I created it so I do not have to bother using the web service too much.

## Features
- current semester grades (*GUI & export to CSV and HTML*)
- all grades (*GUI & export to CSV and HTML*)
- ECTS total
- studies finished status

## Installation
- (optional) set up a python virtual environment (*e.g. with pyenv*)
- install the libraries with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
- run the app with `python main.py`
