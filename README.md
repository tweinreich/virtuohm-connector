# VirtuOhm Connector

This is a tool to collect your information from VirtuOhm (*for students of TH Nuremberg*).

I created it so I do not have to bother using the web service too much.

## Features
- current semester grades (*terminal & export to CSV and HTML*)
- all grades (*terminal & export to CSV and HTML*)
- ECTS total (*terminal*)
- studies finished status (*terminal*)

## Installation
- (optional) set up a python virtual environment (*e.g. with pyenv*)
- install the libraries with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
- run with `python main.py $USER` where `$USER` is your username (*the part before the '@' in your THN mail address*)
- when asked, provide your password
